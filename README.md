### Application Overview ###

The program consists of a launch simulator, velocity and angle calculator for a given target distance, and horizontal range, vertical range, and time of flight table generator for a given velocity. 

### How to run the simulator ###

Run RocketLauncerSimulationGUI.m in order to use the application

### How to use the simulator ###

You must first provide values for the spring constant and projectile mass before running any simulations or calculations.

If you want to run a simulation, input a launch velocity and angle and then press the simulate button. You should see the relevant data appear in the simulation data table and the trajectory graph will animate.

You can also export table data to excel by pressing one of the export buttons, and then providing a file name, sheet name, and start range. Once you click OK, the data will be imported to the excel file you specified. If the file does not exist, it will be created for you.
