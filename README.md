### Application Overview ###

The program consists of a launch simulator, velocity and angle calculator for a given target distance, and horizontal range, vertical range, and time of flight table generator for a given velocity. 

### How to run the simulator ###

Run RocketLauncerSimulationGUI.m in order to use the application

### How to use the simulator ###

You must first provide values for the spring constant and projectile mass before running any simulations or calculations.

If you want to run a simulation, input a launch velocity and angle and then press the simulate button. You should see the relevant data appear in the simulation data table and the trajectory graph will animate.
